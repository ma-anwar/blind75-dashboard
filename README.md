# blind75-dashboard
A dashboard to monitor progress and completion of the [blind75 leetcode questions](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).  

The app uses the MERN stack.
The frontend is in React, the backend is using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

The backend was bootstrapped by the boilerplate [here](https://github.com/drejcreative/mern-boilerplate-2020).

## Setup 
After cloning the repo ensure docker is installed.

Run `docker-compose up` from the root directory to start all the services.

The frontend can then be accessed at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To stop all services run `docker-compose down`
